## Neovim config

Current Neovim config, rewritten early February 2024
*Protanopia-friendly* (red/green colorblindness)

**Current configs:**
- HTML/CSS/JS (JSDoc) -- quite basic, to be refined as I work
- Go (through go.nvim) -- to be rewritten from scratch as I settle on what I do and don't need

**TODO**
- [ ] Add `go.nvim` commands keymaps
- [ ] Add theme transparency toggle
- [ ] Streamline DevX (refactoring, running fns, remove bloat, etc)
- [ ] Implement nice snippets
- [ ] Add good C support (std && AVR for starters)
- [ ] Add good Lua support (mainly for plugin and configs development)
- [ ] Add some Bash support
